## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
Styling for this project was done using a CSS Grid layout. Behaviour of moving thorugh images was made by iterating through an array of image url's to replace the src attribute in an image tag.

## Optimizations
Iteration of the image src and only using one image tag made the code more dry.

## Lessons Learned:
Solved how to repeat the array when we got to the end or start of the array.
